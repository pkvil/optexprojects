\chap Typesetting {\em Metamorphosis}.

\sec Planning the design

{\em Metamorphosis} is a novella divided into three chapters. Each chapter consist of relatively long paragraphs without scene breaks, pictures, or other interruptions.
The chapters have no names, but are simply numbered from I to III. I want the chapters/sections to end up wherever they happen to be in the text, and the headings should not stand out too much.

I want the page number to be at the bottom near the margin. I see no reason for a header so I'll just skip that.

I'm not planning any foreword or prologue pages, and there's little need for a table of contents, so in the end there will be: a title page (recto), a copyright page (verso), and the story itself (starting on a recto page).
